Description: Operations for two-dimensional polygons
 This module provides a few basic geometric operations for two-dimensional
 polygons. Each polygon is represented as an array of two-element arrays
 [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], â€¦], and may either be closed (wherein the first and last
 point are the same) or open (wherein they are not).
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
